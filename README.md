# Plant-Tracker-App
## About this project
This small Ruby on Rails app tracks the watering time for my home plants. I have been neglecting watering my plants and sometimes I am adding to much water to compensate that. Therefore this app should help me improve my plant watering. Moreover it is a small project to improve upon my RoR skills. 

## Planned Features
- [x] adding custom images for each plant (generic/user upload)
- [x] add modern css styling (bulma/tailwind) -> added a custom theme
- [x] plant watering button
- [ ] android/ios compatibility with hotwire
- [ ] save/load plant data?
- [ ] push notifications for overdue plants
